# removePrimeNo
1) In "isprime" method I have written the logic to check prime no.
2) take 2 integers one is for that no which we want to check is it prime or not? and second to store the reminder after devide by 'i'.
3) loop start from 2 to num/2 because every integer is divisible by 1 and itself.
4) In "removeprime" method fisrlty take the size of the arraylist.
5) then start a for loop from list.size()-1 to 0 because if start loop from 0 then after remove the prime no every 
value in the arraylist will shift to left side and we can miss the values.
6) and In the main method take the input and call the "removeprime" and print the result.
